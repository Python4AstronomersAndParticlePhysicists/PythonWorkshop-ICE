## About

This workshop is designed to introduce IFAE and ICE astronomers and particle physicists to modern programming practices in Python specifically applicable to their scientific research. The course is intended to be hands-on so that participants will be able to follow, discuss and reuse the examples explained during each lesson. Sessions will cover from the most basic programming practices to intermediate-advanced tools specific for scientists.

Even the workshop will begin with some beginner lessons, it is recommended to know the basics before starting the workshop. For those who have not programmed in python before, we encourage to take this online python course: http://sthurlow.com/python/ 

We encourage everyone to come with his laptop and run all the examples that each session will be presenting (even this is not mandatory). 

After the first 30 minutes of preparation, teachers will not be able to assist you in your python setup as sessions will need to get started.

So before arriving to the workshop make sure you have a python 2.7 installed with:

    numpy
    scipy
    matplotlib
    pandas
    astropy
    pip
    jupyter

Optionally install also:

    seaborn
    photutils
    pyephem
    astroquery
    sqlalchemy

More instructions on how to install and verify the correct python setup will be detailed soon.
