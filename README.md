## About

This workshop is designed to introduce IFAE and ICE astronomers and particle physicists to modern programming practices in Python specifically applicable to their scientific research. The course is intended to be hands-on so that participants will be able to follow, discuss, and reuse the examples explained during each lesson. Sessions will cover topics from the most basic programming practices to intermediate/advanced tools specific for scientists.

Although the workshop will begin with some beginner lessons, it is *highly* recommended to know the basics before starting the workshop. For those who have not programmed in Python before, we encourage you to take this online Python 3 course: https://www.learnpython.org

We encourage everyone to come with their laptop and run all the examples as they are presented in each session (although this is not mandatory).

The first 30 minutes of the course will be dedicated to setting up Python and the needed packages. After the first 30 minutes of preparation, instructors will not be able to assist you in your Python setup due to time constraints.

Before arriving to the workshop, make sure you have Python 3 installed with:

    numpy
    scipy
    matplotlib
    pandas
    astropy
    jupyter
    pip

These packages are needed for the more advanced sections:

    seaborn
    photutils
    pyephem
    astroquery
    sqlalchemy
    pyephem
    astroplan
    fitsio
    pyspark
    healpy
    pycodestyle
    scikit-learn
    pytest
    ipython-sql

More instructions on how to install and verify the correct Python setup will be detailed soon.
